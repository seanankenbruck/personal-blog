# Welcome

Hi there, and welcome to my blog! In the following posts, I will walk through various subjects that are interesting to me and perhaps useful to others out there who are developing software either professionally or as a hobby. I intend to provide useful examples either directly in the posts themselves or via links to Github projects where you can try some things on your own. Let's start by discussing the code behind this very blog application. 

## Features

- Modern, test-driven personal blog
- Built with Go
- Version controlled content
- Simple deployment to k8s or Azure

This entire application is maintained in a public repository on my Github - [Personal Blog](https://github.com/seanankenbruck/personal-blog). The goal is to continue adding new features to the application as I progress through some of the posts. For example, the next post is related to my initial development efforts on a self-hosted kubernetes cluster using Raspberry Pis. In the future, I will describe in depth how this application has been instrumented with OpenTelemetry so that I can stream telemetry information to a free instance of Grafana Cloud.
