# Welcome

Hi there, and welcome to my blog! I'm excited to have you here. This space is where I'll be sharing my journey through various technical projects, experiments, and ideas that I find fascinating. Whether you're a professional developer, a hobbyist tinkerer, or just someone curious about technology, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

## Why This Blog Exists

Like many developers, I've spent countless hours reading blog posts, documentation, and Stack Overflow answers when trying to solve problems or learn something new. This blog is my way of giving back to that community. I want to share not just the successes, but also the challenges, mistakes, and lessons learned along the way. The best technical content often comes from people who are actively working through problems, and that's exactly what you'll find here.

I believe in learning by doing, so you can expect most posts to include practical examples, code snippets, and links to working projects on GitHub. I'm not here to just theorize about technologyâ€”I want to show you real implementations you can try yourself.

## What to Expect

The topics I cover will range across several areas that I'm passionate about:

- **Cloud-native development**: Kubernetes, containerization, and building scalable applications
- **Infrastructure and DevOps**: From Raspberry Pi clusters to cloud platforms like Azure and AWS
- **Observability**: Monitoring, logging, and making sense of what your applications are actually doing
- **Software engineering practices**: Testing, CI/CD, and building maintainable systems
- **Experiments and side projects**: Sometimes the best learning happens when you're just playing around with new ideas

The posts won't always be polished tutorials with every edge case covered. Sometimes they'll be explorations of a new technology, documentation of a problem I solved, or musings on software development practices. What they will always be is genuine and based on real experience.

## A Note on the Journey

This blog itself is a learning project. I built it from scratch using Go, and it's continuously evolving as I add new features and experiment with different approaches. It was developed on a self-managed Kubernetes cluster running on Raspberry Pis in my home and is deployed to Azure App Services. Every time I work on this site, I'm learning something new about infrastructure, deployment, or web development.

You'll notice that the blog application is completely open source on my [GitHub](https://github.com/seanankenbruck/personal-blog). This transparency is intentional. If you're curious about how something works, you can dig into the code. If you spot something that could be improved, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. This is as much a learning experience for me as it hopefully will be for you. 

# About This Site

Let's talk about the technical details of this blog, because what's a developer blog without some meta-discussion about the blog itself?

This entire application is built from scratch using Go and is maintained in a [public repository on GitHub](https://github.com/seanankenbruck/personal-blog). I chose Go because it's fast, has excellent tooling, and makes it easy to build reliable web services. Plus, I wanted to deepen my Go skills, and building something you'll actually use is one of the best ways to learn.

## Current Features

Here's what the blog can do right now:

- **Modern, test-driven development**: The codebase includes comprehensive tests to ensure reliability
- **Markdown-based content**: All posts are written in markdown with YAML front matter, making them easy to version control and edit
- **Flexible deployment**: Can be deployed to Kubernetes clusters (like my Raspberry Pi setup) or cloud platforms like Azure
- **Container-ready**: Fully containerized with Docker for consistent deployments
- **Version controlled**: Everything, including the content, lives in Git

## What's Coming Next

The beauty of running your own platform is that you can build exactly what you want. Here are some features I'm planning to add:

- **OpenTelemetry instrumentation**: I want full observability into the blog's performance, with metrics and traces sent to Grafana Cloud
- **Search functionality**: Making it easy to find posts on specific topics
- **RSS feed**: For those who prefer feed readers
- **Comments system**: Still debating the best approach for this one
- **Enhanced syntax highlighting**: Better code presentation for technical posts

The goal is to continue evolving this application as I write about new topics. Each post might introduce a new feature or architectural improvement to the blog itself. It's a living project that grows alongside my learning.

## Let's Get Started

If you've made it this far, thanks for sticking around! I'm excited to share this journey with you. My next post dives into my experience setting up a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster using Raspberry Pisâ€”a project that's been both challenging and incredibly rewarding.

Feel free to explore the site, check out the code on GitHub, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions or suggestions. This is just the beginning, and I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes.

Happy reading!
